Accelerated_clock is the program to get the new valie of time when you set other than 1.0 speed while watching/listening video/audio



You understand to finish it will take less time (less that 6 hours),
and even more:
Setting the "speed" you know what fold increase/decrease the time (in 1.5 times).
But what the new time you spent exactly?
The Accelerated_clock program will give you the answer! (4 hours)
			 
			 
  This is not exceptional usefull program, just watching the YT python course on 1.5 or 1.75 speed I decide to write this just for fun and get the saved time as a result.
 
 Think that it is my way to optimize personal time during learning something, and my way to learn something (befor July, 10th of 2021 I'd written code on Python)
